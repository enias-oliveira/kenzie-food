Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used.

Fresh fruit often is sprinkled with lime juice  and chaat masala.    

Black salt (which is actually a reddish gray), available at  Indian food stores, has a distinctive flavor that's quite different from sea salt or table salt.

Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.

And whether you decide to pick your own or buy from a favorite roadside vendor, serving fruit with any meal is, well, a berry good idea. Not only do fruits make a colorful and flavorful accompaniment to breakfast, lunch or dinner, they make a refreshing and healthy snack in the middle of a hot day or under a welcoming shady tree on an outing with family or friends.  HELPFUL HINTS Storing berries: After selecting healthy-looking berries - you'll want to avoid bruised or moldy fruit of any kind - refrigerate them in a single layer, loosely covered. To freeze, arrange washed berries in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in freezer until solid. Transfer them to a plastic freezer bag or container, leaving half-an-inch at the top. Return to freezer.

ANY quick bread-type cake can be  baked in canning jars. Lighter cakes tend to fall once the jar seals. I usually  bake one jar first -- you have to know how high the batter rises. I usually fill  ONE jar 1/2 full then bake it to see how high it rises, then go from there. You  don't want the cake to come out of the top of the jar, only to within 1/4 to 1/2  inch from the lip of the jar. Write it down on your recipe (how far you filled  the jars)! Once you've established how high the cake rises, you can go from  there. The first time around is a bit tricky because you won't know how many  jars you'll need. MOST of the recipes I've tried I end up using around 8.    Sterilize as many jars as you think you'll need and go from there. Make sure  your LIDS are new, the rings don't ha  ve to be As the jars do seal, the cakes are  as moist as the day you put them into the jars--sometimes MORE SO. The baking  times will vary.",Dessert,"c(""< 60 Mins"", ""< 15 Mins"", ""For Large Groups"")",377.9,19.8,2.8,46.5,327.0,48.1,2.4,31.6,4.9,16.0

For a puffy cookie, use shortening to keep the dough from flattening.   Get a softer cookie by sweetening it only with brown sugar. Combine brown with granulated sugar for a crispier cookie.

I've gotten several z-mails asking about the candy coating. They are wafers that you melt to then dip candies into to coat them. They are usually sold in the candy section of craft or baking stores. I've seen them in the candy making section of Wal-Mart also. If you look at the ingredients photo on Recipe #104941, you'll see a photo of them.

Honestly, these are the best onion rings I have ever had.  If you've seen other recipes for onion rings, you'll probably notice the absence of buttermilk and the presense of chicken or vegetable stock here.

""These aren't difficult to make, but they look fancy because they  have three distinct layers.  A shortbread crust is topped by a  chocolate layer, which is then topped with a thin walnut layer. The bars freeze well, and they'll keep for several days at room temperature if stored airtight.  I've even mailed these successfully, wrapping them in pairs with the bottoms together and packaging them in a sturdy, well-padded carton before placing them in a similarly sturdy, well-padded box.  The most important thing to remember about these bars is that the chocolate layer needs some time to set up, even after the bars have cooled to room temperature.  I usually make the bars the night before I'm going to cut and serve them, but chilling the bars after they've cooled for about 20 minutes should have the same effect.""",Bar Cookie,"c(""Dessert"", ""Cookie & Brownie"", ""Fruit"", ""Nuts"", ""Oven"", ""< 4 Hours"")",205.8,14.0,6.6,37.6,8.9,19.9,1.1,14.4,2.5,

Many of our recipes are derived from the local community and are featured in this annual derby event. Some history of the Hard Crab Derby, held every Labor Day, follows:  &quot;The first derby was held fifty-two years ago in 1947. This first derby was a simple, uncomplicated affair by today's standards. It consisted of a number of crabs being unceremoniously dumped in the center of a circle which was painted on the street in front of the Post Office.  From these humble beginnings the National Hard Crab Derby has grown into one of Crisfield's most successful festivals. The derby has changed locations many times and is now held on the grounds of the Somers Cove Marina. The race format has also been altered. Instead of the crabs being dumped in the center of a circle, they each have their own &quot;starting gate&quot;. Once this gate is opened the crabs scurry down a platform to the finish line. In addition to the regular crab derby there is now a governor's cup race in which the governors of the states which constitute our union enter a crab contestant. Entries from Hawaii (1967) and Alaska (1968) have even won this race. The first cooking contest was held in 1965. This popular event was won in that year by Nina Coons of Marion Station. Nina entered a delicious crab casserole as her award winning recipe. Because of its superior cooking facilities, the contest has been held in Crisfield High School. Winning chefs have been mainly from Maryland with a few from Delaware and Pennsylvania.&quot;",Crab,"c(""Potato"", ""Vegetable"", ""< 60 Mins"", ""Oven"")",469.2,16.8,9.4,131.6,685.8,47.0,3.9,4.2,32.6,4.0

In the original recipe it said to use 1/2 cup olive oil......I have changed this to 1/4 cup and feel this is better.

These are so good and when I found out how easy they are to make, I was sold! Personally I like to  use semi sweet chocolate chips, but that is personal preference. Split you wafers before  placing in the pan but fit them tightly together--the grahams that split to approx 1x2 inches are ideal, but cut them to the size you like.  After you have made the almond roca and cooled the tray, put it in the freezer for only 10 minutes to really solidify the chocolate.  Then remove from freezer and flip the whole tray so you can see where the graham wafer splits are. It is then very easy to just slice gently with a knife and you get perfect cut pieces.

You do not add any water with this recipe. It is cooked on the lowest number on your stove - there is enought moisture in thc cabbage that comes out as it slowly cooks.  I cover the pot after adding the caraway seeds. Remember to stir each time you pass the stove.  As mentioned by Swedish Chef in her review her MIL added an apple - I tried it and it is excellent.
